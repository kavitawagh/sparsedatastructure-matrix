# Sparse Data Structures for Matrix
Implementation of data structures for storing sparse matrices in coordinate(COO) format, compressed sparse row(CSR) format, compressed sparse column(CSC) format with relevant functions using C language.

The file `ProblemStatement.odt` contains the problems that are solved here. The `testcases` folder contains the testcases that are successfully passed by this code. The `code` folder contains the actual code files. The notes about different sparse matrix representations are available in `SparseDataStructs.pdf`. For more details on the program, see `code\README`.

### How to run this code?

1. Download and unzip the repository.
2. Open Terminal/Command Promp
3. In Terminal, navigate to the `code` folder in this repository.
4. Type `make` command and press enter. This command will generate object 
	file for the program. (Do this step whenever you make any changes in code.)
5. To run the program, type `./a.out` command and press enter.
